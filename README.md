# DyteCodeEditor

The following are the instructions to use this code editor:

(A little heads up, I've never used React and this is my first time trying this out. So I've refered google whenever I got stuck anywhere.)

1. The first thing you'll need to do it set up your server through node. The latest version of node and npm installed in your system. 
2. Once everything's set up, execute npm install to download all the dependancies. 
3. Execute client/src/App.js and .env and update them according to your Channels credentials (channel credentials I got from Pusher).
4. Then execute node server.js to start the express server.
5. Now cd into the client folder, run npm install followed by npm start to start the development server. 
6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
